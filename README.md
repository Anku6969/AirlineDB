# AirlineDB
This repository contains the SQL Capstone Project, which involves solving various complex queries using the Airline DB database. The project is designed to test and enhance SQL skills by providing practical, real-world scenarios related to airline operations.

Key Features:

Date and Time Manipulation: Queries involving the formatting and extraction of date and time data from flight records.

Joins and Subqueries: Utilization of joins and subqueries to retrieve and analyze data across multiple tables.

Aggregations and Ranking: Implementation of functions like GROUP BY, HAVING, and window functions to rank and summarize data.

Data Filtering: Advanced filtering techniques to identify specific records, such as flights with the highest range or those that were canceled or delayed.

The project covers a broad spectrum of SQL concepts, making it an excellent resource for those looking to deepen their understanding of database management and query optimization. The repository includes both the problem statements and the corresponding SQL queries for each task.
